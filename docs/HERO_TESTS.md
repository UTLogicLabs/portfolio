# Hero Component Test Implementation

## Overview

Comprehensive unit tests have been created for the `Hero` component using Vitest and React Testing Library. The test suite provides complete coverage of the hero section functionality, styling, accessibility, and responsive design.

## Test Summary

- **Total Tests**: 30 tests across 8 test categories
- **Test File**: `/tests/unit/components/Hero.test.tsx`
- **Test Status**: ✅ All 30 tests passing
- **Test Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library

## Test Categories

### 1. Component Structure (2 tests)
- Hero section rendering with correct styling
- Container and grid layout structure

### 2. Hero Content (3 tests)
- Main heading (h1) with "John Doe" and proper styling
- Subtitle "Senior Software Engineer" with correct styling
- Description paragraph with professional bio

### 3. Call-to-Action Buttons (3 tests)
- "Contact Me" primary button with anchor link to #contact
- "View Projects" secondary button with anchor link to #projects
- Responsive button container layout

### 4. Social Media Links (5 tests)
- GitHub link with proper external link attributes
- LinkedIn link with proper external link attributes
- Twitter link with proper external link attributes
- Email link with mailto: functionality (no target="_blank")
- Social links container styling

### 5. Profile Image (3 tests)
- Profile image with proper alt text and source
- Image container with responsive sizing classes
- Image section layout and positioning

### 6. Accessibility (4 tests)
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1)
- Screen reader text for all social icons
- Descriptive alt text for profile image
- Proper link text for navigation

### 7. Responsive Design (5 tests)
- Responsive typography classes (text-3xl, sm:text-5xl, xl:text-6xl)
- Responsive layout classes (py-12, md:py-24, lg:py-32)
- Responsive grid classes for desktop layout
- Responsive button layout (flex-col to flex-row)
- Responsive image sizing

### 8. Icon Integration (2 tests)
- All social media icons with correct names and sizes
- Icon names from sprite system (github-logo, linkedin-logo, twitter, mail)

### 9. Content Structure (3 tests)
- Proper content hierarchy and spacing
- Name and title grouping
- All content sections in correct order

## Mock Strategy

The test suite uses a mock implementation of the `Icon` component:

```typescript
vi.mock('@/components/ui', () => ({
  Icon: ({ name, size }: { name: string; size: number }) => (
    <div data-testid={`icon-${name}`} data-size={size}>
      {name}
    </div>
  ),
}));
```

This provides predictable testing without depending on the actual sprite system.

## Key Testing Patterns

### 1. DOM Querying
- Uses `document.querySelector('section')` for section element
- Uses `screen.getByRole('link', { name: /pattern/i })` for social links
- Uses `data-testid` attributes for reliable icon testing

### 2. Content Validation
- Verifies hero heading and subtitle rendering
- Checks call-to-action button attributes and styling
- Validates professional description content

### 3. Link Testing
- Ensures external links have `target="_blank"` and security attributes
- Verifies email link doesn't open in new tab
- Tests correct href values for all navigation links

### 4. Responsive Testing
- Validates mobile-first responsive classes
- Checks grid layout breakpoints
- Tests typography scaling across breakpoints

## Test Fixes Applied

During implementation, these issues were resolved:

1. **Section Role Query**: Changed from `getByRole('region')` to `document.querySelector('section')` since `<section>` doesn't have implicit region role
2. **Social Link Selection**: Used `getByRole('link', { name: /pattern/i })` instead of `getByLabelText()` for more reliable link finding
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Proper validation of screen reader text and ARIA attributes

## Integration with Project

The Hero tests integrate seamlessly with the existing test suite:
- **Total Project Tests**: 97 tests passing across 5 component files
- **No Conflicts**: Tests work alongside existing Footer, ProjectsSection, LinkedInFeed, and Icon tests
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follows same testing patterns as other components

## Usage for Future Development

These tests provide:
- **Regression Protection**: Ensures hero section remains stable during updates
- **Documentation**: Serves as living documentation of component functionality
- **Development Confidence**: Allows safe refactoring with immediate feedback
- **CI/CD Ready**: Prepared for continuous integration pipelines

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run Hero tests only
npm run test tests/unit/components/Hero.test.tsx

# Run all component tests
npm run test tests/unit/components/

# Run with verbose output
npm run test tests/unit/components/Hero.test.tsx -- --reporter=verbose
```

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the Hero component, ensuring all aspects of the landing page hero section function correctly across different devices and user interactions.
